browser\_mod
============

A Home Assistant integration to turn your browser into a controllable entity - and also an audio player.

## Example uses

- Make the camera feed from your front door pop up on the tablet in your kitchen when someone rings the doorbell.
- Have a message pop up on every screen in the house when it's bedtime.
- Make the browser on your workstation switch to a specific tab when the kitchen light is on after midnight
- Play a TTS message on your work computer when the traffic sensor tells you it's time to go home.

# Installation instructions

*NOTE: This integration required Home Assistant version 0.95 or later*

- Copy the contents of `custom_components/browser_mod/` to `<your config dir>/custom_components/browser_mod/`.

- Add the following to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
browser_mod:
```

- Restart Home Assistant

# Usage

## Devices
The most basic concept of `browser_mod` is the *device*.

A *device* is a machine-browser combination identified by a unique `deviceID`. The `deviceID` is randomly generated and may look like `ded3b4dc-abedd098`.

- Chrome on your desktop and Chrome on your laptop are two different *devices*.
- Chrome on your laptop and Safari on your laptop are two different *devices*.
- Two tabs in Firefox on the same computer is the same *device*.
- Two windows in Edge on the same computer is the same *device*.

In the two latter cases, the last loaded tab/window will be the *active* one.

Note: Incognito mode will generate a new `deviceID` and thus a new *device* every time it's started.

### Aliases
Since the deviceID can be a bit hard to remember for devices you use often, you can specify an alias in `configuration.yaml`

```yaml
browser_mod:
  devices:
    99980b13-dabc9563:
      name: Arrakis
    d2fc860c-16379d23:
      name: dashboard
```
This binds the *aliases* `Arrakis` to `99980b13-dabc9563` and `dashboard` to `d2fc860c-16379d23`.

Note: Aliases must be unique.

## media\_player
Once `browser_mod` is installed, loading up your Home Assistant frontend on a new *device* will create a new `media_player` device.

Any sound played on this media player will be played by the *device*.

The `media_player` entity also has some extra attributes presenting the current state of the *device*.

| attribute | content |
| --- | --- |
| `path` | The currently displayed path on the *device*. |
| `visibility` | Whether the frontend is currently visible on the *device*. |
| `userAgent` | The User Agent of the associated browser. |
| `currentUser` | The user currently logged in on the *device*. |

## `browser_mod.command` service

Call the `browser_mod.command` service to control your *device* in various ways.

All service calls have two parameters in common, `command` which is the command to execute, and `deviceID` which is a list of *devices* to execute the command on. If `deviceID` is omitted, the command will be executed on **all** currently connected *devices*.

`deviceID` may also contain aliases, and there's a special alias named `this` which will evaluate to the *device* from which a command was initiated (if from the frontend).

### set-theme

```
service: browser_mod.command
service_data:
  command: set-theme
  theme: clear_light
```

will set the current theme to `clear_light` on all devices.

### navigate
```
service: browser_mod.command
service_data:
  command: navigate
  navigation_path: /lovelace/1
  deviceID:
    - ded3b4dc-abedd098
```

will open your second lovelace view on just the *device* `ded3b4dc-abedd098`.

*Note: `navigation_path` does not have to be a lovelace path. All paths in Home Assistant works.*

### more-info
```
service: browser_mod.command
service_data:
  command: more-info
  entity_id: camera.front_door
  deviceID:
    - ded3b4dc-abedd098
    - dashboard
```

will show the more-info dialog of `camera.front_door` on the *devices* `ded3b4dc-abedd098` and `dashboard`.

The optional parameter `large: true` will make the popup wider.

### popup
```
service: browser_mod.command
service_data:
  command: popup
  title: Popup example
  card:
    type: entities
    entities:
      - light.bed_light
      - light.kitchen_lights
      - light.ceiling_lights
  deviceID:
    - this
```

will display the specified `entities` card as a popup on the current device.

![popup-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1299821/60288984-a7cb6b00-9915-11e9-9322-324323a9ec6e.png)

The optional parameter `large: true` will make the popup wider.
The optional parameter `style:` will apply css style options to the popup.

Ex:
```yaml
  style:
    border-radius: 20px
    --ha-card-border-radius: 20px
    --ha-card-background: red
```

Note: Sometimes this doesn't work if the *device* is not currently displaying a lovelace path. I'm looking into that...

### close-popup
```
service: browser_mod.command
service_data:
  command: close-popup
```

will close all more-info dialogs and popups that are open on all connected *devices*.

## `browser-player` card

To control the playback in the current *device*, `browser_mod` includes a custom lovelace card. Just add

```yaml
type: custom:browser-player
```

anywhere in your lovelace configuration.

The player card also displays the `entityID`. Click it to select, so you can copy it.

# FAQ

### Does this replace lovelace-player and lovelace-browser-commander
Yes.

Some improvements

- With the backend support `browser_mod` does the same things as both of those, but better.
- Since `browser_mod` uses a service for executing commands rather than events, the commands can be easily triggered by any lovelace element which has a `tap_action` setting.
This actually means it pretty much replaces `popup-card` as well.
- `browser_mod` uses websockets to get immediate feedback from the *device* to the backend and much better tracking of disconnects.
- *Aliases*. 'nuff said.
- `browser_mod` works outside of `/lovelace`.
- This works even if the currently logged in user is not in the admin group.

### Does this replace lovelace-fullykiosk
It will, eventually.
